# Commonly used file formats for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data

## FASTA

Among the most common and simplest file formats for representing nucleotide sequences is FASTA.  Essentially, each sequence is represented by a 'header' line that begins with a '>', followed by lines containing the actual nucleotide sequence. By convention, the first 'word' in the header line is a unique identifier, which is usually as accession number. Consider this example of a FASTA-formatted nucleotide sequence:

    >LC719646.1 Influenza A virus (A/swine/Tottori/B34/2020(H1N1)) segment 8 NS1, NEP genes for nonstructural protein 1, nuclear export protein, complete cds

    TGCAAGCCTTACAACTACTGCTTGAAGTAGAGCAAGAGATAAGAGCTTTCTCGTTTCAGCTTATTTAA

- The first line begins with '>' indicating that it is the header line.
- This is immediately followed by 'LC719646.1', which is an accession number for [this sequence in the GenBank database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LC719646.1).
- Then follows the actual nucleotide sequence, split over several lines, beginning with 'ATGGAATCCAACA...' and ending with '...TTATTTAA'.

It is very common to combine multiple sequences into a single multi-FASTA file like this:

    >ON084923.1 Influenza A virus (A/ostriches (Struthio camelus)/Egypt/Mansoura1/2022(H5N8)) segment 4 hemagglutinin, HA2 region, (HA) gene, partial cds

If you want a more detailed history of the FASTA file format, then you could take a look at the Wikipedia page here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format.

## FASTQ
The widely used FASTA file format has the great advantage of simplicity. However, this simplicity can be restrictive if we want to include additional data/metadata in addition to the sequence.
Given the non-negligible error rates of NGS technologies, often we need to accompany our sequence data with quality scores that estimate our confidence in the accuracy of the sequence data. As we will see later, this allows us to perform quality control checks and filter-out poor-quality data before performing analyses.
FASTQ is a simple text-based format that allows us to include quality scores. A single sequence is represented by four lines of text:

    @ERR8261968.1 1 length=97
    ACTTTCGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTCTAAACGAACTTTAAAATCTGTGTGGCTGTCACTCGGCTGCATGCTTAGTGCACTCACGCAGTATAATTA
    +ERR8261968.1 1 length=97
    CCCCCFDDFFFFGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHHGHHIIHHGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGHHHHHHH

- The first line is a 'header' containing a unique identifier for the sequence and, optionally, further description.
- The second line contains the actual nucleotide sequence.
- The third line is redundant  and can be safely ignored. Sometimes it simply repeats the first line. Sometimes it is blank or just contains a '+' character.
- The fourth line contains a string of characters that encode quality scores for each nucleotide in the sequence. Each single character encodes a score, typically   a number between 0 and 40; this score is encoded by a single character, as we saw during the introductory lecture.

| Character | ASCII | FASTQ quality score (ASCII – 33) 
| --|--|--
| ! | 33 | 0
| “ | 34 | 1
| # | 35 | 2
| $ | 36 | 3
| % | 37 | 4
| ... | ... | ...
| C | 67 | 34
| D | 68 | 35
| E | 69 | 36
| F | 70 | 37
| G | 71 | 38
| H | 72 | 39
|40 | 73 | 40

So, in the example above, we can see that most of the positions within the 97-nucleotide sequence have scores in the high 30s, which indicates a high degree of confidence in their accuracy.
- A score of 30 denotes a 1 in 1000 chance of an error, i.e. 99.9 %accuracy.
- A score of 40 denotes a 1 in 10,000 chance of an error, i.e. 99.99 %accuracy.

## SAM and BAM

A SAM file (usually named *.sam) is used to represent aligned sequences. It is particularly useful for storing the results of aligning genomic or transcriptomic sequence reads aligned against a reference genome sequence. The BAM file format is a compressed form of SAM. This has the disadvantage that it is not readable by a human but has the advantage of being smaller than the corresponding SAM file and thus easier to share and copy between locations.

We can view BAM files graphically using a specialised genome browser software such as:
